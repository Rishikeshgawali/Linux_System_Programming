# Linux System Programming Assignment

## Description
This repository contains solutions for various problems related to Linux System Programming, focusing on the following areas:
- **File Management**
- **Memory Management**
- **Process Management**

The solutions provided are aimed at helping to understand the core concepts of system programming in a Linux environment, such as how the operating system handles files, memory, and processes.

## Contents
The repository is organized into the following sections based on the topics covered:

- **File Management**: 
  - Various programs and scripts demonstrating file handling in Linux, such as file creation, reading, writing, and manipulation using system calls.
  
- **Memory Management**: 
  - Solutions focusing on dynamic memory allocation, memory mapping, and handling memory resources efficiently using system calls like `malloc`, `free`, `mmap`, etc.
  
- **Process Management**: 
  - Programs implementing process creation, termination, signaling, and process synchronization using system calls such as `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`, `signal()`, and others.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following tools installed:
- A Linux-based operating system (or a virtual machine running Linux).
